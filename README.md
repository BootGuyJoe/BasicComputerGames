This repository contains all my self-taught lessons in BASIC, mostly coming from the classic book, "BASIC COMPUTER GAMES" by David Ahl.

This one is pretty interesting... the books was written for MS Basic 8080, which works on most machines build on the Intel 8080 chip.
Obviously, you're not going to find many of those around. However, I'd still like to get the knowledge and experience of the late 1970s pioneers,
and somehow make it applicable to today's world.

So my mission here is two-fold:
1. Reproduce the original programs as they were intended to work. This can be done using an dosbox + the GW-BASIC emulator. These files will be have the prefix "old_g*".
2. Convert the games to the modern vb.NET language. These files will have the prefix "new_g*".

Maybe one day I'll release a new edition of the book with the vb.NET games, eh? =)
